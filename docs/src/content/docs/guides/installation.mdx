## How to use nvdots
Add nvdots to your flake.
```nix
nvdots = {
  url = "github:Voxi0/nvdots";
  inputs.nixpkgs.follows = "nixpkgs";
};
```

### As a package

<Steps>

1. Add the package to `home.packages` or `environment.systemPackages` or whatever and configure it however by wrapping it with your own stuff.
	```nix
	home.packages = [
		(inputs.nvdots.packages.${pkgs.stdenv.hostPlatform.system}.neovim.wrap ({pkgs, ...}: {
		# extraPackages = with pkgs; [];
		# specs.<spec_name> = {
		#     # Add more plugins to this spec
		#     data = with pkgs.vimPlugins; [];
		#
		#     # Extend this spec with your own Lua config
		#     config = ''
		#     '';
		# };
	    }))
	];
	```

</Steps>

### As an overlay

<Steps>

1. Add the overlay to your `pkgs` instance. Note that this will replace `pkgs.neovim` with the package that nvdots exports.
	```nix
	pkgs = import inputs.nixpkgs {
	    inherit system;
	    overlays = [inputs.nvdots.overlays.default];
	};
	```
2. Configure nvdots however you want by wrapping the package with your own stuff.
	```nix
	home.packages = [
		(pkgs.neovim.wrap ({pkgs, ...}: {
		# extraPackages = with pkgs; [];
		# specs.<spec_name> = {
		#     # Add more plugins to this spec
		#     data = with pkgs.vimPlugins; [];
		#
		#     # Extend this spec with your own Lua config
		#     config = ''
		#     '';
		# };
	    }))
	];
	```
</Steps>
