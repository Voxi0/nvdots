This is my personal [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) configuration.

## How it works

- [nixCats](https://nixcats.org/) - The package manager which focuses on
  allowing one to manage plugins and other dependencies for Neovim in Nix. This
  way, all dependencies are downloaded by Nix while Neovim is configured in Lua.
  Check the website to learn why it would be better compared to alternatives
  such as [NVF](https://github.com/notAShelf/nvf) and
  [Nixvim](https://github.com/nix-community/nixvim)
